# Bug_detection_mysql
Overview:
 This project is designed to track and manage the entire process of bug detection and resolution within a software development cycle. It utilizes a MySQL database to store and manage critical information related to bugs, from their discovery to their final resolution.
The database structure captures key details about bugs, such as their unique identifier (bug ID), the name of the bug, status updates, assigned developers, and resolution details.

Features:
 Bug Detection: Capture the initial bug information such as Bug ID, Bug Name, and the time the bug was discovered.
Bug Status Management: Track the status of each bug (e.g., open, in progress, resolved) throughout the detection and resolution phases.
Resolution Process: Record detailed information about how bugs were resolved, including steps taken and the date of resolution.
Developer Assignment: Assign bugs to specific developers for fixing and tracking progress.
History of Updates: Maintain a history of all changes made to the bugâ€™s record, including updates on status, assignment, and resolution.
